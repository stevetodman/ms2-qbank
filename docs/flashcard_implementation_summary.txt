FLASHCARD IMPLEMENTATION STATUS - QUICK REFERENCE
================================================

WHAT'S IMPLEMENTED:
  [X] Frontend route at /flashcards
  [X] Navigation menu link
  [X] Placeholder component
  [X] References in dashboard
  
  Implemented Files:
  - /home/user/ms2-qbank/web/src/routes/FlashcardsRoute.tsx (stub only)
  - /home/user/ms2-qbank/web/src/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx (nav link)

WHAT'S MISSING (Critical):

BACKEND SERVICES (0% complete):
  [ ] Flashcard FastAPI service (/src/flashcards/ directory)
  [ ] Data models (Deck, Card, ReviewRecord, SpacedRepetitionState)
  [ ] CRUD endpoints for decks and cards
  [ ] QBank integration endpoints
  [ ] Review submission endpoint
  [ ] Data persistence layer (JSON or database)

SPACED REPETITION ENGINE (0% complete):
  [ ] SM-2 algorithm implementation
  [ ] Interval calculation (1 day, 3 days, 7+ days pattern)
  [ ] Ease factor tracking per card (starts at 2.5)
  [ ] Next review date scheduler
  [ ] Quality rating system (0-5 scale)
  [ ] Edge case handling

FRONTEND COMPONENTS (0% complete):
  [ ] Deck browser (ReadyDecks + SmartCards tabs)
  [ ] Deck editor (create, edit, delete)
  [ ] Card editor (rich text, images, tables)
  [ ] Review interface (flip card, confidence buttons)
  [ ] Import from QBank dialog
  [ ] Statistics dashboard

READYDECKS CONTENT (0% complete):
  [ ] 2,000+ expert-created flashcards
  [ ] System-organized collections (Anatomy, Pharmacology, etc.)
  [ ] Images and diagrams for visual cards
  [ ] Database fixtures

QBank INTEGRATION (0% complete):
  [ ] Auto-create cards from questions
  [ ] Bulk import from test results
  [ ] Import marked/incorrect questions
  [ ] Link cards to source questions
  [ ] Update cards when questions change

DECK MANAGEMENT (0% complete):
  [ ] Deck templates
  [ ] Public/private decks
  [ ] Deck sharing
  [ ] Progress tracking per deck
  [ ] Deck statistics
  [ ] Streak tracking

RELATED SERVICES NEEDED:
  [ ] Analytics hooks for card reviews
  [ ] Search API integration for card indexing
  [ ] Auth system integration (multi-user support)
  [ ] Mobile sync support

ESTIMATED EFFORT: 3-4 weeks (250-350 developer hours)

CRITICAL PATH (in order):
1. Data models definition (1-2 days)
2. Spaced repetition algorithm (2-3 days)
3. FastAPI service + basic endpoints (3-4 days)
4. Frontend review interface (5-7 days)
5. QBank integration (2-3 days)
6. ReadyDeck content creation (3-5 days)

KEY TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Spaced repetition has many edge cases requiring thorough testing
- Multi-device sync needed for mobile apps (not yet built)
- Need to handle 2,000+ cards efficiently (index/pagination)
- Rich text editor will be complex component
- Medical expertise required for ReadyDeck content

RELATED PRD FEATURES DEPENDING ON THIS:
- Dashboard flashcard reminders
- Study Planner integration (schedule card reviews)
- Notebook to flashcard conversion
- Performance analytics for card learning
- Mobile app sync

DATABASE SCHEMA (if using SQL):
  - decks table (id, user_id, name, type, created_at)
  - flashcards table (id, deck_id, card_type, front, back, images)
  - card_reviews table (id, card_id, user_id, quality, ease_factor, interval, next_review_date)

FILE STRUCTURE (if using JSON):
  data/flashcards/
    ├── decks.json
    ├── cards.json
    ├── reviews.json
    └── statistics.json

COMPARISON TO EXISTING SERVICES:
This should be modeled after:
- Assessment service (/src/assessments/) - CRUD + state management
- Review service (/src/reviews/) - workflow + state transitions
- Planner service (/src/planner/) - scheduling logic
